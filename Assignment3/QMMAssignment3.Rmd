This notebook contains the code for the examples in Chapter 5. Specifically, for postoptimality analysis.

```{r}
library(lpSolveAPI)
```

***
getwd()

```{r}
rm(list=ls())

x <- read.lp("Assignment3.lp") # create an lp object x
print(x)                          # display x
```


1. Solve the problem using lpsolve, or any other equivalent library in R.
```{r}
solve(x) # solving the given lp equation ,'0' optimal solution exists
get.objective(x)  # get objective value of x which is profit =  696000 $
get.variables(x)  # get values of decision variables of x which is 9 decision variables
get.constraints(x)  # get constraint LHS  values

```

2. Identify the shadow prices, dual solution, and reduced costs

```{r}

get.dual.solution(x) # Dual values for reduced cost.

get.sensitivity.rhs(x)  # get shadow prices of the constraints the shadow prices are 12.00 , 20.00 and 60.00 and the negative value is for non - negativity. By dualsfrom and dualstill we have wide range of of dual values for the constraints 
get.sensitivity.obj(x)  # get reduced cost The reduced costs are expressed here from $objfrom and $objtill, 
get.sensitivity.rhs(x)$duals[1:11] #  shadow price 

get.sensitivity.rhs(x)$duals[12:20] # reduced price 
```

Further, identify the sensitivity of the above prices and costs. That is, specify the range of shadow prices and reduced cost within which the optimal solution will not change.


```{r}
cbind(get.sensitivity.rhs(x)$duals[1:11], get.sensitivity.rhs(x)$dualsfrom[1:11],get.sensitivity.rhs(x)$dualstill[1:11])   # By dualsfrom and dualstill we have wide range of of dual values for the constraints 

# the range of the shadow price and reduced cost is from negative 1 to  positive 1 


cbind(get.sensitivity.rhs(x)$duals[12:20], get.sensitivity.rhs(x)$dualsfrom[12:20],get.sensitivity.rhs(x)$dualstill[12:20]) # reduced price range from -1 to 1 for o and the respective in the row wise.

```

```{r}

dual<-read.lp ("dual1.lp")
dual
```


```{r}
# '0' optimal solution exists

set.bounds(dual, lower = c(-Inf,-Inf), columns = 10:11)

solve(dual)

get.objective(dual)#  The objective value for the dual is 698000.4 while the objective in primal is 696000, there is a slight difference over 2000.4 for dual,as Y10 and Y11 are non existing constraints in primal 

get.variables(dual)        #  values of decision variables for dual functions which are 11 

get.constraints(dual) #  9 constraints of the dual function. 
```

```{r}
get.sensitivity.rhs(dual)$duals#  shadow price of the dual is equal to the variables in primal.
```

get.sensitivity.obj(dual)  # the vales of the sensitive 

```
